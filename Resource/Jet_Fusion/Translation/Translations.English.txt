TEXT_GODDARD_UPG_DESC_02		The Goddard Cart is a three wheeled racer that was originally built to beat Cindy in the Retroville Cart Race. Sleek and fast, this Cart is sure to win any race it is in.

TEXT_CREDITS_139 NOTE: The Adventures of Jimmy Neutron
TEXT_CREDITS_140 Boy Genius: Jet Fusion is a total blast,
TEXT_CREDITS_141 'cause it contains all the cool stuff
TEXT_CREDITS_142 Jimmy dreams up. That's right!
TEXT_CREDITS_143 It's a fantasy world. None of it is real!
TEXT_CREDITS_144 So, stuff like zapping, bopping
TEXT_CREDITS_145 and spraying other characters
TEXT_CREDITS_146 should never, ever be acted out in
TEXT_CREDITS_147 the real world. You can enjoy
TEXT_CREDITS_148 it in the game, but in the
TEXT_CREDITS_149 game ONLY! Have fun!
TEXT_CREDITS_150 Gotta Blast!
