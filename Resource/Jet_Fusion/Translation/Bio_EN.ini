[JIMMY]
Jimmy Neutron is a boy "genius, knowing" a lot about science, but little about life.
He thinks most things can be solved with a mathematical equation or the invention of a new gizmo.
He built his own robot "dog, Goddard," for the science fair and uses his best friend Carl as a test subject for many scientific endeavors.
Most of "Jimmy’s inventions are put together using unconventional means, with" sometimes less-than-desired results.
For "example, an" ordinary toaster is used to create a makeshift satellite (and it works)...
Yet "he’s developed a robot that mis-ties his shoes..."
And his shrink ray unknowingly backfires and shrinks someone BEHIND him.
Genius "aside, Jimmy is your typical kid: he" takes his parents for granted (until he needs them)... has a vivid imagination...
and he might have a crush on Cindy "Vortex, but" you’d never know it by how they argue!
Not counting his "gravity-defying hairdo, Jimmy’s the shortest kid in class and must be in bed by 9 o’clock."

[CALAM]
Professor Finbarr Calamitous is a brilliant and evil scientist with a tragic flaw... "he’s unable to finish anything, whether" it’s jelly donuts, sentences or evil inventions.
Unwilling to let that small disability stand in "his way, the tiny, near-sighted Professor" is determined to get fellow genius (and Lindbergh School alum) Jimmy Neutron to finish his inventions for him.
Professor Calamitous can often be seen flying around in an "imposing, high-tech armored suit, though only for short stretches, as" he forgot to install a bathroom.
Father to the aptly named Beautiful "Gorgeous, Professor C. would love to bring her into the family business if she weren’t consumed by bitter father-daughter" issues.

[JET]
"Neutron’s favorite action hero, secret" agent Jet Fusion has got nerves of steel and muscles to match!
After graduating from "Harvard, Princeton and MIT and serving briefly as a stunt man and extreme sport maniac, he was" recruited by the BTSO (Big Top Secret Organization).
His brilliance and physical talent made him the model secret agent with the "perfect cover: Action Movie" Super Star.
After he met his number "one fan, our own Jimmy Neutron, they teamed up to outwit the evil Professor" Calamitous and his dangerous daughter Beautiful Gorgeous.
Jet is the go-to guy for "action and adventure! Just ask Jimmy Neutron... still his #1 fan and now his partner!"

[GODDARD]
Goddard is "Jimmy’s friend, conscience and faithful pet. As a robot dog, Goddard can transform" into a variety of useful tools.
"He’s like a high tech," barking pocket knife!
Goddard gets his "puppy-like energy from the wall outlet, into which he’s plugged to recharge."
Did we mention "he’s a portable phone booth, too?"
Or that he can simulate Jimmy’s voice?
"Well, he is... and he can!  But although he’s the ultimate in cybernetics, he can’t resist chasing cats, begging" for treats or burying a really fine chrome bone.

[SHEEN]
Sheen is not the brightest bulb on the Christmas tree. "He’s totally enamored by the fictional Ultra Lord" action hero.
He collects all the figures and quotes him daily.
"Okay, you could say Sheen’s" a little obsessive.
